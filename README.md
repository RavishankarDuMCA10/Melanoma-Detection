# Melanoma Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
### Algorithm Used

Convolutional Neural Network

### Dataset Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

### Steps involved
- Importing all the important libraries
- Data Loading and Create datasets
- Visualize one instance of all the nine classes present in the dataset
- Baseline Model Building
- Training the Model and Visualizing training results
- Building an augmented model
- Training the augmented model and Visualizing training results
- Checking and rectifing Class Imbalance with augmentor
- Building the final model
- Training the final model and Visualizing training results
- Verifying the model
